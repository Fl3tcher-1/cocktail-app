This is a personal project that uses JS in order to fetch and consume a public api containing cocktails (api link at the bottom)

on load or refresh the website will return a random cocktail to the user

The user is able to use the search bar to search for a cocktail-- where we will call the api and display matching results, with the name, ingredients and method to create back to the user

this project will also incorporate google ad sense and will allow users to pick between metric and imperial measures

this project may incorporate user authenitication in order to allow them to view past results

this project may also allow the user to search different categories e.g. shot, cocktail, ordinary drink etc...
